            <p> 
               Now 1 year deep into my life at Krome, heres what I have been working on.
               <br><br>
               Woah, a year already?! That has flown by, and what a journey it has been. I am much more settled at the company now and the team is a whole lot more stable. I have been focussing on much of the same stuff as my last personal journey blog with a few additional bits. I have successful obtained the DarkTrace certification I was studying for. I am now working towards the Palo Alto Network Security Professional certification, so watch this space!
               <br><br>
               There was one area that I did notice needed improving in our team, or at least saw an opportunity to make, not only my life easier but pretty much every tech's life easier at the company with the creation of the “Support Matrix”. Upon starting my life at Krome, I was given my access credentials, and shadowed serval colleagues which allowed me to grasp how they worked and how they accessed information. It was a great help, but I quickly became asking the same questions; Who is the approver for this site? Where is the credential for this server? Where is the documentation for this configuration? You get the idea. Now, they had the information, but each person was getting it from a different place (often their own notes) and I thought, there must be an easier was of dealing with this. In addition, there were 5 new starters set to join me in my team in the coming months, and I just knew they would be having all the same questions as me. 
               <br><br>
               Then I found an out-of-date excel file called “OOH-Matrix” which stood for Out Of Hours Matrix. Mainly for the 24/7 support team. It had a couple companies in there with dribs and drabs of information, and I felt I had struck gold as someone had previously had the same idea but never really saw it through. Anyways I grabbed a copy and began removing any old clients and adding the ones I had been dealing with.
               <br><br>
               My consensus was that; as soon as a ticket comes in, this document is to be the initial springboard to answer any trivial questions there may be as to how to handle the request. If the information was not in there… THEN ADD IT! Bit by bit, day by day this consensus spread among my peers and even different departments started to use it and update it. Suddenly there is a single source of truth and understanding interdepartmentally. This was a HUGE win not only for me but for the company as it reduced the frustration of people assuming people knew things because they did, instead now everyone knows where everyone stands and because everyone can see what is in this document. 
               <br><br>
               This continued to grow over the coming months and now contains pretty much everything we need to do our jobs effectively, efficiently and most importantly, stress free. Most of the time. 
               <br><br>
               Moreover, the reason I said it was a springboard earlier was because not only does it contain information but there are embedded links to all the relevant 3rd party software's we use to monitor, manage and support client infrastructure. A very very very useful document. So much so, that I ended up winning employee of the month for September for the creation/revival of the document. Alongside, working really hard, going above and beyond on multiple occasions and mapping out other potential bottlenecks in other processes throughout the organisation. Mainly just me moaning constructively though! 
               <br><br>
               Since then, I have had glowing feedback, and it has been noticed org-wide that this department is streaks ahead of where it was before I joined. Not only that but all my teammates who have joined since my creation of the doc have said how much easier it made their lives in the first few weeks and months of them joining Krome and that makes me feel good.
               <br><br>
               From winning employee of the month came with a juicy Amazon gift card that I promptly treated myself to a Raspberry Pi5. Oh yes, then I set out to create and host my very first webapp. Leveraging AI, I built and deployed a real-time cyber threat intelligence web app that aggregates multiple OSINT feeds (e.g., Shodan/URLhaus/ThreatFox), normalises and caches indicators, and streams live updates to a globe dashboard with analytics and historical reporting. 
               <br><br>
               It was really cool and I really enjoyed making it. I plan to keep on creating into the future. 
               <br><br>
               So yeah, a really good year in my opinion. 
               <br><br>
