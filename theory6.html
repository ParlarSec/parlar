    <h2>Threat Intelligence</h2><br>
    <p>In today's complex cyber landscape, understanding and anticipating threats is crucial for effective defense. Threat intelligence provides organisations with actionable insights about existing and emerging threats. Let's explore what threat intelligence is and why it's a critical component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br><br></p>
    <h3>What is Threat Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge about existing or emerging threats that helps organisations make informed security decisions. It includes context, mechanisms, indicators, implications, and actionable advice about threats. Rather than simply reacting to incidents, threat intelligence enables a proactive approach to cybersecurity.<br><br>
        Good threat intelligence provides information about threat actors, their motives, capabilities, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) they employ - all contextualized for your specific organisation's risk profile.<br><br></p>
    <h3>Why Is Threat Intelligence Important?</h3>
    <p>With cyber threats becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted, organisations need to stay ahead of attackers. Here's why threat intelligence matters:<br><br>
        <strong>• Proactive Defense:</strong> Allows organisations to anticipate and prepare for potential threats before they manifest.<br>
        <strong>• Informed Decision-Making:</strong> Provides context to security alerts, helping teams prioritize responses effectively.<br>
        <strong>• Resource Optimisation:</strong> Helps focus security resources on the most relevant threats to your organisation.<br>
        <strong>• Reduced Attack Surface:</strong> Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.<br>
        <strong>• Faster Response:</strong> Enables quicker identification and mitigation of threats when they do occur.<br><br></p>
    <h2>Types of Threat Intelligence</h2>
    <h4>Strategic Intelligence</h4>
    <p>Strategic intelligence provides high-level information about the changing threat landscape. It's designed for non-technical audiences and focuses on broader trends, risks, and their potential business impact. This type of intelligence helps executives make informed decisions about security investments and risk management strategies.<br><br></p>
    <h4>Tactical Intelligence</h4>
    <p>Tactical intelligence provides information about attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It helps security teams understand how attacks are conducted and implemented. This intelligence is valuable for developing detection strategies and defensive measures that can identify and block malicious activities.<br><br></p>
    <h4>Operational Intelligence</h4>
    <p>Operational intelligence provides specific details about impending attacks or campaigns. It includes information about the nature, timing, and targets of attacks, allowing organisations to take specific defensive measures. This intelligence is particularly useful for incident response teams preparing for or responding to security events.<br><br></p>
    <h4>Technical Intelligence</h4>
    <p>Technical intelligence consists of specific indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as malicious IP addresses, domains, file hashes, or vulnerabilities being exploited. This intelligence can be directly implemented into security controls for automated detection and blocking of known threats.<br><br></p>
    <p>By combining these four types of threat intelligence, organisations can develop a comprehensive understanding of the threat landscape at multiple levels and time horizons, enabling more effective security operations.<br><br></p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)</h3>
                <p>Intelligence collected from publicly available sources, including forums, social media, news reports, academic publications, and government data. OSINT provides broad context about emerging threats but requires filtering to identify relevant information.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Commercial Feeds</h3>
                <p>Subscription-based services that provide curated threat intelligence, often tailored to specific industries or threat types. Commercial feeds typically offer high-quality, vetted intelligence but can be costly to maintain across multiple providers.</p>
