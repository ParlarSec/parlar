    <h2>THE MISSION</h2>
    <p>We are a cyber security collective dedicated to not only securing businesses from evolving cyber threats, but educating those businesses to become more security conscious to help them STAY secure long after we are gone.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><i>"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. <br> Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."</i></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>I mean, sure you could have a dedicated MSSP looking after cyber intrests, but do they take the time to discuss with you all of the techinal jargon that went right over your head?
        I have been in those situations myself (on both sides) and things move way to quick to be double checking if everyone understands every last point of every meeting. This is where we come in.
        An independant, impartial third-party that has no intrest in your money... We just want you to be secure! And to be stacked up with understanding so you know what to ask on your next service review with your MSSP.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>But in all honesty, this page is not really for corporate businesses that have the money to finance IT support or MDR services, we are for the small to medium size business that do not have resources to aquire such luxury.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>If you do not have the "luxury" of having someone else look after your cyber intrests, here are 5 ways you can become more cyber scure:</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
    <p>Yes... on every account (personal and work).<br></p>
    <h3>Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h3>
    <p>Use a password manager (this does not mean saving your credentials in a browser...).<br></p>
    <h3>Keep Software Up to Date</h3>
    <p>This one couldn't be more simple, and it's free! Hit the Windows key, check for updates, and make sure you reboot your machine everyday (or everytime you use it, if it's not daily).<br></p>
    <h3>Install and Use Antivirus Software</h3>
    <p>This does not mean Free Antivirus Software... Purchase a dedicated, reputable one.<br></p>
    <h3>Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links or Email Attachments</h3>
    <p>Be cautious when receiving unsolicited emails, links, or attachments, especially from unfamiliar sources. Phishing attacks are common and can compromise your security.<br></p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is something we often overlook until something goes wrong. But protecting yourself online isn't just about having the most impenetrable system—it's about not being the most vulnerable. Think of it like locking the doors and windows to your house. If your neighbor leaves their door wide open, the thief might choose them instead of you, simply because it's easier. 
        Cybercriminals work the same way. They're looking for the path of least resistance, and if they see an account or device that's poorly protected, it becomes an easy target.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>It's not about being completely invulnerable—because, in this digital age, that's nearly impossible—but about ensuring you aren't the lowest hanging fruit. You don't want to be the easiest pick for those who are looking to exploit others. Simple steps, like creating strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, or being cautious with emails, can make all the difference.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>By taking small actions to improve your security, you create a barrier that makes it harder for others to gain access. You're not just safeguarding your personal information; you're also contributing to the broader digital ecosystem's safety. When we all make these efforts, we help reduce the opportunities for cybercriminals to thrive.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>In the end, it's about peace of mind. Knowing that you've done what you can to protect yourself means you don't have to worry about falling prey to something preventable. It's not about being perfect; it's about doing enough to make sure you're not the easy target.</p>
