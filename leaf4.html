            <section>
            <p>I am set to start my next role in the IT world in the next couple of days: Second Line Technical Support Engineer 24/7 at Krome Technologies.
        <br><br>
        I am super excited to see what this role has in store for me, and I am intrigued to see how Krome Technologies operates. As it is a bigger organisation than the last company I worked for, I am interested to see; how different the general day-to-day operations are, how different the client base is, and how the services offered differ from my last place.
        <br><br>
        Also, something else will definitely be differentâ€¦ my working hours! Yes, I am sure you would have noticed the 24/7 shift engineer bit. I have never done this type of work, but I am eager to give it a go. It actually fits in with what I want to achieve this year so we will see how it goes but I am optimistic. 
        <br><br>
        How this fits with my personal goals for this year: As I will be working 12 hours shifts, 4-on-4-off, obviously the days are longer, but I can look forward to those 4 days off right around the corner. In addition, I was leaving the house at 7:40am to get to the office and not getting home until 6pm working at my last place (which works out as over 50hrs a week) and now, with ZERO commuting, because Krome Technologies is in my town, I will purely be doing the 4 x 12 hour shifts (48 hours) a week, and that's not even taking into account the extra added breaks at 2 hours per shift. 
        <br><br>
        As my shifts will fall on weekends, when I get my 4 days off, this will fall on days during the week, so I can use these days to focus on personal goals to further propel me in my IT career. I probably won't even see it as <i>'a day off'</i> and still get up and ready as if I am going to work but instead, working for myself on my own goals. I want to approach it with a level of professionalism and respect so I can get it done without any excuses. 
        <br><br>
        Personal goals in the crosshairs: 
        <br><br>
        HTB Bug Bounty Hunter job role path
        <br><br>
        HTB Penetration Tester job role path
        <br><br>
        HTB SOC Analyst job role path
        <br><br>
        Then obtaining at least one of the three certifications that HTB offer. At the moment I have my eyes on: HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist.
        <br><br>
        
        <br><br>
        Once those are complete, I do have one bonus goal that would be a dream come true if I were able to achieve it. I would like to be able to find, submit and get paid for finding a bug/vulnerability for a business that has a bug bounty program live.
        <br><br>
        Here's to the next chapter!
