    <h2>Digital Forensics</h2><br>
    <p>In an increasingly digital world, the field of digital forensics has become vital for investigating cybercrimes and security incidents. Digital forensics involves the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices to collect evidence for legal proceedings or internal investigations. Let's explore what digital forensics is and why it's crucial in today's technology-driven environment.<br><br></p>
    <h3>What is Digital Forensics?</h3>
    <p>Digital forensics is the process of identifying, preserving, analysing, and presenting digital evidence in a manner that is legally admissible. It's the application of scientific methods to recover data from digital devices while maintaining its integrity. This discipline ensures that evidence is collected and handled in a way that preserves its evidentiary value in legal proceedings.<br><br>
        Digital forensics experts use specialized tools and techniques to uncover hidden, deleted, or encrypted information from devices without altering the original data - a principle known as maintaining the chain of custody.<br><br></p>
    <h3>Why Is Digital Forensics Important?</h3>
    <p>As our lives and businesses become increasingly digital, so too do the crimes and incidents that affect us. Here's why digital forensics is critical:<br><br>
        <strong>• Evidence Collection:</strong> It provides scientifically sound methods to collect digital evidence for legal proceedings.<br>
        <strong>• Incident Response:</strong> It helps organisations understand the scope and impact of security breaches.<br>
        <strong>• Intelligence Gathering:</strong> It enables the extraction of actionable intelligence from digital artifacts.<br>
        <strong>• Attribution:</strong> It assists in identifying the perpetrators behind cybercrimes and attacks.<br>
        <strong>• Prevention:</strong> Findings from forensic investigations help improve security measures to prevent future incidents.<br><br></p>
    <h2>Core Digital Forensics Methodologies</h2>
    <h4>Identification</h4>
    <p>The first step involves recognizing potential sources of evidence and determining what data might be relevant to the investigation. This includes identifying devices, storage media, cloud accounts, and network resources that may contain evidence.<br><br></p>
    <h4>Preservation</h4>
    <p>Evidence must be preserved in its original state. This typically involves creating forensic images (bit-by-bit copies) of storage media, capturing volatile memory, and documenting the state of systems. Chain of custody procedures are strictly followed to ensure evidence integrity.<br><br></p>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>This is where investigators examine the collected data to extract relevant information. Techniques include file recovery, timeline analysis, metadata examination, searching for keywords, and analysing user activities. Specialized tools help process large volumes of data efficiently.<br><br></p>
    <h4>Documentation</h4>
    <p>Throughout the investigation, detailed documentation is maintained regarding all procedures followed, tools used, and findings. This creates a transparent record that can withstand scrutiny in legal proceedings and provides context for the evidence.<br><br></p>
    <h4>Presentation</h4>
    <p>The final step involves presenting findings in a clear, understandable format for various audiences - whether legal professionals, executives, or technical teams. This often includes reports, expert testimony, and visualisations that explain complex technical concepts in accessible ways.<br><br></p>
    <p>By following these methodologies, digital forensics professionals can conduct thorough investigations while maintaining the integrity and admissibility of the evidence they collect.<br><br></p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Computer Forensics</h3>
                <p>The examination of computer systems, focusing on hard drives, storage devices, and operating systems. It involves recovering deleted files, analysing system logs, examining file metadata, and reconstructing user activities to establish timelines of events.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Mobile Device Forensics</h3>
                <p>Specialized techniques for extracting and analysing data from smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. This field deals with challenges like proprietary operating systems, encryption, and the recovery of data from apps, call logs, messages, and location services.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Network Forensics</h3>
                <p>The capture, recording, and analysis of network traffic and events to discover the source of security attacks. Investigators examine network logs, packet captures, and traffic patterns to trace the origin of attacks and understand how they were executed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Memory Forensics</h3>
                <p>The analysis of a computer's volatile memory (RAM) to extract evidence that would be lost when the system powers down. This includes running processes, open network connections, unencrypted passwords, and malware that exists only in memory.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cloud Forensics</h3>
